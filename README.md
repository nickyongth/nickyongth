## 🙋🏻‍♂️ Hello, I'm Nicky Ong

My journey into data analytics ignited with Spotify Wrapped – a revelation of how music preferences could unfold intricate stories about personality and lifestyle. This epiphany, merging my love for puzzles and discovery, propelled me to uncover meaningful insights and trends through data.

Currently, I'm enriching my expertise with a Master's Degree in Business Analytics at the University of Washington. Beyond numbers and charts, you'll find me relishing a game of tennis, embarking on spontaneous road trips, or setting new personal bests in the gym. My pursuit is a blend of analytical rigor and a zest for life's varied experiences.
